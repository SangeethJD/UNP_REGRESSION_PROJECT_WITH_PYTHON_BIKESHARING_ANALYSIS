# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_BIKESHARING_ANALYSIS

As part of the UNP Value-Added Course on Data Analytics, I developed a machine learning project to predict bike rental demand using Python. The project involved extensive data preprocessing such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, normalizing continuous variables, and removing irrelevant columns. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I identified key patterns between factors like temperature, humidity, season, and working days affecting bike usage. I built and compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to forecast total rentals, evaluating their performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics. The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing complex patterns. This project improved my skills in data preprocessing, regression modeling, model evaluation, and real-world predictive analysis.
